# Comprehensive Analysis of MOD 2 Phase Assessments in the Advanced Operation Course

#### Data Analyst: Mr. Jason Ballard, CGSS, Curriculum Development Support Team- Analytics
#### Completed:  February 27, 2024

This document provides a detailed analysis of various assessments undertaken during the MOD 2 phase of the Advanced Operation Course. The analysis spans different dimensions of student performance, including the distribution of weighted total scores, division movement plans, online exam results, and the contribution to group learning (CTGL). Through a series of visualizations—histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, violin plots, heatmaps, facet grids, and pair plots—we examine central tendencies, spread, skewness, outliers, and correlations among different metrics. This multifaceted approach allows us to draw comprehensive insights into student performance, instructional effectiveness, and assessment design.

## Key Findings and Insights

### Weighted Total Scores and Division Movement Plans
The analysis of weighted total scores and division movement plans revealed a high concentration of scores in the A range, suggesting consistent performance among students and potentially effective teaching methodologies. However, the presence of a bimodal distribution in the division movement plans points to varying levels of understanding or application among students, warranting a review of instructional methods or materials.

### Online Exam Results
The examination of online exam results, particularly comparing U.S. students with International Military Students (IMS), highlighted differences in preparation levels or prior knowledge, with IMS students generally achieving higher scores. This discrepancy suggests the need for further investigation into study resources and support systems available to each group.

### Contribution to Group Learning (CTGL)
The CTGL scores analysis underscored the importance of a standardized rubric for assessing participation grades, aiming for equity in assessment and providing detailed, actionable feedback to students. The correlation between CTGL and weighted total scores across different teams highlighted varying performances, suggesting room for curriculum adjustments and further support for lower-performing students.

### Visualizations and Correlation Analyses
Through various visualizations, including boxplots, violin plots, and facet grids, we observed the distribution of CTGL scores across teams, identifying patterns of performance, variability, and outliers. The correlation heatmap provided insights into the relationships between different assessment metrics, revealing redundancies and the need for assessment diversification.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The thorough analysis of the MOD 2 phase assessments has illuminated areas of strength in the Advanced Operation Course, such as high overall performance and effective teaching strategies, as well as areas needing attention, like the need for assessment review and additional student support. To further enhance the learning experience and assessment strategies, the following recommendations are proposed:

- **Instructional and Assessment Review**: Refine instructional materials and assessment criteria to address observed bimodal distributions and ensure clarity and accessibility for all students.
- **Standardized Rubrics**: Implement standardized rubrics for subjective assessments like CTGL to ensure fairness and provide clear expectations and feedback.
- **Curriculum Adjustments**: Adjust the curriculum to provide a range of challenges that can distinguish between varying levels of student mastery, particularly for assessments showing high concentrations of scores within a narrow range.
- **Support for Lower-Performing Students**: Identify common challenges and provide targeted support to students scoring at the lower end of the distribution.
- **Further Investigation into Exam Preparation**: Investigate differences in exam preparation and support systems between U.S. and IMS students to address disparities in performance.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish feedback mechanisms for students to share their experiences and perceptions of exams and assignments, facilitating continuous improvement of teaching and assessment practices.

This comprehensive analysis not only sheds light on the current state of student performance and assessment efficacy within the Advanced Operation Course but also sets the foundation for ongoing improvements in curriculum design, teaching strategies, and student support mechanisms.
